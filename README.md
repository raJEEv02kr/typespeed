# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Typing Speed Test Web Application** is a simple and interactive web-based tool designed to measure a user’s typing speed and accuracy. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project helps users practice typing while also demonstrating core front-end development concepts.

The application calculates **Words Per Minute (WPM)**, **typing accuracy**, and tracks **time remaining** during a fixed-duration typing test. It is suitable for beginners, students, and anyone learning JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.

## 🚀 Features

* ⏱️ 60-second typing test timer
* 🧮 Automatic calculation of **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
* 🎯 Typing **accuracy percentage** calculation
* 🎨 Clean and user-friendly interface
* 🔁 Restartable test
* 💻 Fully client-side (no backend required)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the application
* **CSS** – Styling and layout design
* **JavaScript** – Logic, timer, calculations, and interactivity

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-speed-test.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click on `index.html`
   **OR** open it in any modern web browser.
4. Click **Start Test** and begin typing.

## 📊 How It Works

* The user clicks **Start Test**, enabling the text area and starting a 60-second timer.
* As the user types, input is recorded.
* When the timer ends:

  * **WPM** is calculated based on words typed.
  * **Accuracy** is calculated by comparing typed characters with the given text.
* Results are displayed instantly on the screen.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

* JavaScript DOM manipulation
* Event listeners and user input handling
* Timers using `setInterval()`
* String comparison and basic calculations
* Structuring a simple front-end project

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Random paragraph generation
* Live character highlighting (correct/incorrect)
* Multiple difficulty levels
* Result history tracking
* Mobile responsiveness improvements
